Business model and figures
	

We aim to provide an affordable service to our users with a possible pay per use rate, 
where a viewer can choose which streamers they may prefer depending on their appropriate 
stats and preferences which will be available on our website and application. 
Bridging the gap between the streamer, the audience and the various sponsors 
is something that may often time be overlooked in the world of streaming. 
In the case of big events, lots of resources are required for the successful operation of said event. 
This would mean that our users will be given a priority to such events with a reduced entry 
fare or various special offers which are part of our premium membership scheme. 
The premium membership scheme is available to all users with a one-time yearly subscription 
fee of €70. Naturally, the benefits of being a premium member do not just guarantee priority 
in our events but also ensure that you have a stream/sponsor experience that is tailored for you.
	
If possibly a yearly subscription isn’t really your thing, or you just want to watch or attend a few 
select streams or events only? We can still accommodate you giving you pay per use access to all our 
streams/events accordingly. Naturally these will depend from one stream or event to the other, but 
generally speaking the rate is around €1 per Stream.
